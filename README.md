Notes:

    - Changed manual/automated coordinates to pixel coordinates:
        (0, 0) at the center, between -(image width/height)/2 to +(image width/height)/2

    - Added "Reset Reference Point" in Menu Bar --> Action for setting the reference point back to (0, 0) (center of image)

    - Disabled "Save" for Automated Tips Animation

    - Length was right, didn't need to fix, just used the wrong variable when putting into text box. fixed that
    included the bound check for ref point
